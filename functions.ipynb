    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The last basic of Python programming to introduce are **functions**. By using functions, we are able to run sections of code with different inputs *without rewritting the common statements*. You've already seen functions whenever you call `print()` or other common pieces of code we've used in previous modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what the structure of a function looks like in Python and break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(argument1, argument2,...,):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Description of function\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Function statements\n",
    "    return(return_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Name:**  \n",
    "The function name is how you use it later on in the code. use a well-described function name (E.g. `sum_numbers` instead of `function_1`. This make it easier for others to understand (and for you to remember when you come back to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments:**  \n",
    "While not required, you will most likely want to write functions that take in arguments. These act as variables within your function that take on the values that you pass in when you run later. There are different types of arguments, which we will discuss later. Arguments can be of any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docstring:**  \n",
    "Docstrings are not required, but can provide additional comments and description of your function. Things to include in a docstring can include a description of the arguments and what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function Statements:**  \n",
    "These are what the function will do everytime you call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return Value:**  \n",
    "If you want to return any calculations you have done within a function, you will need to use the `return` statement. You can only return one value from a function. To get around this limitation, you can return multiple values as a tuple."
